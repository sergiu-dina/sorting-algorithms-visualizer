# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This app was built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is used to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as quick sort, merge sort, insertion sort, etc.

The app is deployed with GitHub Pages and can be accesed here: https://sergiu-dina.github.io/sorting-algorithms-visualizer/ .I hope you have fun playing around with it

## Purpose

I wanted to improve my skills with JavaScript and also learn classic sorting algorithms. This project turned out to be a great way to achieve both of the aforementioned objectives at the same time.

## App Design

The app has a simple user interface where you can generate a new array of numbers, change the array size and sorting speed, select the algorithm that you want to see and finally a sorting button to start the process.

Here is the app in action:
