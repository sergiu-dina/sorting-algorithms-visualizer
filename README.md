This app was built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is used to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as quick sort, merge sort, insertion sort, etc.

The app is deployed with GitHub Pages and can be accesed here: https://sergiu-dina.github.io/sorting-algorithms-visualizer/ .I hope you have fun playing around with it
